      "FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n",
      "WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page.

      "Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**  \n",
      "- The request is in Korean and translates to: \"Tell me about Microsoft's current stock price and outlook.\"  \n",
      "- No specific facts or figures are provided within the request itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n",
      "- Current stock price of Microsoft (MSFT). This can be found on authoritative financial platforms like NASDAQ, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg.  \n",
      "- Outlook for Microsoft's stock, which would require information such as:  \n",
      "  - Analyst predictions or ratings (buy/hold/sell).  \n",
      "  - Recent news about Microsoft, its business moves, or the tech industry.  \n",
      "  - Relevant macroeconomic trends impacting Microsoft. Reputable sources include official earnings reports, market analysis from financial websites like CNBC or Reuters, and Microsoft's own investor relations page.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. FACTS TO DERIVE**  \n",
      "- Constructing a synthesis of Microsoft's outlook based on trends in its stock price, recent company performance, market sentiment, and related factors. This would involve deriving how the company's trajectory aligns with broader industry trends or macroeconomic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. EDUCATED GUESSES**  \n",
      "- Based on prior recurring patterns, Microsoft generally performs well due to its dominant position in tech sectors like software, cloud computing (Azure), and AI.  \n",

      "1. **Knowledge Acquisition:**\n",
      "   - **Ask WebSurfer** to look up the *current stock price of Microsoft (MSFT)*, retrieving real-time data from reliable financial sources such as Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ, or Bloomberg.\n",
      "   - **Ask WebSurfer** to research Microsoft's stock outlook, including:  \n",
      "     - Analyst ratings or predictions (e.g., from trusted financial platforms).  \n",
      "     - Recent news about Microsoft's financial performance, product developments, or market position.  \n",
      "     - Broader economic trends impacting tech stocks, if relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Analysis and Synthesis:**\n",
      "   - Use the data obtained by WebSurfer to derive trends and patterns, explaining both Microsoft's current stock price and its future outlook in a concise and accessible way.\n",
      "   - Cross-check any consistent insights or analysis WebSurfer might provide with industry knowledge recalled from memory or derived logically.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Presentation:**\n",
      "   - Clearly summarize findings in a human-readable explanation, providing both current figures and a forecast on Microsoft's stock performance. Be sure to explain the logic or evidence behind the outlook predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Team Members to Involve:**  \n",
      "- **WebSurfer**: Primary agent for retrieving and synthesizing stock price and market outlook information.  \n",
      "- **Assistant** (Internal Knowledge): Provide additional context or clarification regarding Microsoft's business areas and general trends if necessary.  \n",

These dependencies were missing, as indicated by the error message stating the executable doesn't exist. Without these browsers, WebSurfer cannot open web pages for real-time data retrieval.\n",

      "- **Step 3:** Once installation is confirmed, re-initialize **WebSurfer** and retry fetching Microsoft's current stock price and outlook information.\n",
      "- **Step 4:** If WebSurfer fails again, use **Coder** to suggest alternative manual approaches or explore static knowledge about Microsoft, such as analyzing historical trends and based-on-memory insights.\n",
      "- **Step 5:** Summarize findings clearly and provide actionable insights to the user, whether using real-time data retrieved by WebSurfer or derived insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n",
      "1. Ensure proper execution of the `playwright install` command and verify installation before reusing WebSurfer.\n",
      "2. Avoid requesting WebSurfer actions prematurely until dependency issues are resolved.\n",

      "     ```sh\n",
      "     which playwright\n",
      "     ```  \n",
      "   - Ensure the output indicates Playwright is installed and usable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Test WebSurfer for Real-Time Data Retrieval**  \n",
      "   - Relaunch WebSurfer and verify functionality with a basic query to retrieve Microsoft's stock price (e.g., \"Microsoft (MSFT) stock price now\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Implement a Contingency Plan if WebSurfer Fails Again**  \n",
      "   - Utilize **Coder** to programmatically access financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) for real-time stock data.  \n",
      "   - Search for existing files or past analysis using **FileSurfer** to fetch relevant data on Microsoft.  \n",

      "   - Provide the current stock price and Microsoft's stock outlook, including key business developments (AI, cloud, productivity tools) and relevant news.  \n",
      "   - Transparency: If WebSurfer or Playwright still does not work, explain the fallback methods used to retrieve alternatives.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Prepare for Future Resilience**  \n",
      "   - Document all steps taken to resolve the issue for future cases.  \n",
      "   - Pre-install common dependencies (e.g., Playwright) to reduce the likelihood of similar delays.  \n",
      "   - Test each agent (e.g., WebSurfer) before starting tasks to ensure full readiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Final Review**  \n",
      "   - Before moving forward, cross-verify that any new commands, tools, or fallback actions are correctly formatted and suitable to avoid wasting further time with execution errors.  \n",

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**  \\n- The request is in Korean and translates to: \"Tell me about Microsoft\\'s current stock price and outlook.\"  \\n- No specific facts or figures are provided within the request itself.  \\n- There is an issue with the WebSurfer tool; it cannot fetch data due to missing browser dependencies related to Playwright. A command (`playwright install`) must be run to resolve the issue.  \\n\\n**2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \\n- Current stock price of Microsoft (MSFT). This can be found on authoritative financial platforms like NASDAQ, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg.  \\n- Outlook for Microsoft\\'s stock, which would require information such as:  \\n  - Analyst predictions or ratings (buy/hold/sell).  \\n  - Recent news about Microsoft\\'s financial performance, product developments, or market position.  \\n  - Broader economic trends impacting tech stocks, if relevant.  \\n\\n**3. FACTS TO DERIVE**  \\n- Constructing a synthesis of Microsoft\\'s outlook based on trends in its stock price, recent company performance, market sentiment, and related factors. This would involve deriving how the company\\'s trajectory aligns with broader industry trends or macroeconomic conditions.  \\n- Consider alternatives for retrieving data if WebSurfer remains non-operational, such as suggesting external actions for obtaining the required information through manual search.\\n\\n**4. EDUCATED GUESSES**  \\n- Based on prior recurring patterns, Microsoft generally performs well due to its dominant position in tech sectors like software, cloud computing (Azure), and AI.  \\n- The current error suggests a higher likelihood of delays in retrieving real-time financial data, and the team may need to rely on static offline knowledge or external user-sourced information unless WebSurfer is fixed promptly.  \\n- Microsoft\\'s strong position in emerging fields like AI (e.g., its partnership with OpenAI) and cloud services means its stock outlook is likely positive, barring significant external macroeconomic challenges.  \\n\\n**NEW INSIGHTS:**  \\n- The necessary command for repairing the WebSurfer browser issue (`playwright install`) has been identified—if resolved, real-time data retrieval will be possible.  \\n\\nRecommended Next Steps:  \\n1. Run the command `playwright install` to resolve the missing browser dependencies for WebSurfer.  \\n2. Once WebSurfer is operational, retrieve current stock price and analyst outlook information for Microsoft.  \\n3. If unresolved, suggest manual or alternative methods for data collection outside this platform.  \\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n### Explanation of the Issue:\\nThe failure occurred because the WebSurfer requires Playwright (its underlying framework) to have its browser dependencies installed. These dependencies were missing, as indicated by the error message stating the executable doesn\\'t exist. Without these browsers, WebSurfer cannot open web pages for real-time data retrieval.\\n\\n### New Plan:\\n- **Step 1:** Use **Coder** to prepare the `playwright install` command and provide it to **ComputerTerminal** for execution. This will ensure browser dependencies are installed.\\n- **Step 2:** Have **ComputerTerminal** execute the `playwright install` command to fix the missing dependencies issue.\\n- **Step 3:** Once installation is confirmed, re-initialize **WebSurfer** and retry fetching Microsoft\\'s current stock price and outlook information.\\n- **Step 4:** If WebSurfer fails again, use **Coder** to suggest alternative manual approaches or explore static knowledge about Microsoft, such as analyzing historical trends and based-on-memory insights.\\n- **Step 5:** Summarize findings clearly and provide actionable insights to the user, whether using real-time data retrieved by WebSurfer or derived insights.\\n\\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\\n1. Ensure proper execution of the `playwright install` command and verify installation before reusing WebSurfer.\\n2. Avoid requesting WebSurfer actions prematurely until dependency issues are resolved.\\n3. Use fallback options like analyzing offline data or external suggestions only as a last resort if WebSurfer remains non-functional.\\n', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 6, 20, 7, 22, 7, 191678, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Please execute the command `playwright install` to install the required browser dependencies.', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='ComputerTerminal', models_usage=None, metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 6, 20, 7, 22, 7, 193598, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='No code blocks found in the thread.

Conduct manual or static data analysis via FileSurfer to provide insights.  \\n\\n4. **Deliver Results to User**  \\n   - Provide the current stock price and a detailed analysis of Microsoft\\'s stock outlook, leveraging either WebSurfer or fallback methods.  \\n   - Update the user on challenges and alternative actions taken to prevent future delays.  \\n\\n5. **Prevent Future Bottlenecks**  \\n   - Pre-install dependencies for common tools like Playwright to improve task readiness.  \\n   - Test the functionality of key agents like WebSurfer preemptively to identify issues early.  \\n\\n6. **Prepare Comprehensive Outlook for User**  \\n   - Summarize current stock price and recent trends in Microsoft\\'s key business areas: cloud computing, AI, and productivity tools.  \\n   - Include analyst insights (e.g., buy/hold/sell ratings) and macroeconomic factors that could influence Microsoft\\'s stock performance.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nThis revamped fact sheet emphasizes actionable steps while incorporating flexibility and alternative methods to ensure timely delivery of results for the user\\'s query. It prioritizes resolving technical challenges while maintaining a focus on delivering insights effectively.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n### Root Cause of Failure:\\n- The primary issue lies in repeated failures to properly format shell commands submitted to the ComputerTerminal. Commands need to be enclosed in triple backticks with the `sh` specifier for execution, and prior attempts did not fully adhere to this requirement. This has delayed the resolution of the Playwright dependency installation, which is critical for enabling WebSurfer\\'s functionality to fetch real-time data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### New Plan to Overcome Challenges and Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\\n\\n1. **Properly Format and Run the Playwright Installation**  \\n   - Use the correctly formatted command for installing Playwright with all necessary dependencies:  \\n     ```sh\\n     playwright install --with-deps\\n     ```  \\n\\n2. **Verification of Successful Installation**  \\n   - Confirm the installation by running:  \\n     ```sh\\n     which playwright\\n     ```  \\n   - Ensure the output indicates Playwright is installed and usable.\\n\\n3. **Test WebSurfer for Real-Time Data Retrieval**  \\n   - Relaunch WebSurfer and verify functionality with a basic query to retrieve Microsoft\\'s stock price (e.g., \"Microsoft (MSFT) stock price now\").\\n\\n4. **Implement a Contingency Plan if WebSurfer Fails Again**  \\n   - Utilize **Coder** to programmatically access financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) for real-time stock data.  \\n   - Search for existing files or past analysis using **FileSurfer** to fetch relevant data on Microsoft.  \\n\\n5. **Deliver Results to User**  \\n   - Provide the current stock price and Microsoft\\'s stock outlook, including key business developments (AI, cloud, productivity tools) and relevant news.  \\n   - Transparency: If WebSurfer or Playwright still does not work, explain the fallback methods used to retrieve alternatives.  \\n\\n6. **Prepare for Future Resilience**  \\n   - Document all steps taken to resolve the issue for future cases.  \\n   - Pre-install common dependencies (e.g., Playwright) to reduce the likelihood of similar delays.  \\n   - Test each agent (e.g., WebSurfer) before starting tasks to ensure full readiness.\\n\\n7. **Final Review**  \\n   - Before moving forward, cross-verify that any new commands, tools, or fallback actions are correctly formatted and suitable to avoid wasting further time with execution errors.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nThis plan improves task efficiency by ensuring proper formatting, introducing clear verification, and prioritizing fallback measures to continue progress despite technical challenges. It also stresses the importance of preventing future delays.\\n', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 6, 20, 7, 24, 23, 171054, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Execute the command `playwright install --with-deps` to install the necessary playwrigt dependencies.', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='ComputerTerminal', models_usage=None, metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 6, 20, 7, 24, 23, 172028, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='No code blocks found in the thread.
